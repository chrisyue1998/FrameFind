# FrameFind

This was my capstone project for the Design, Cultures, and Creativity honors program at the University of Maryland; it is a proof of concept application that attempts to flip the current glasses-shopping paradigm by matching glasses frames with the customer instead of having the customer find the frames. All work in this project was my attempt at learning the basics of Machine Learning (through using Deep Learning) and UI programming. I was able to apply the knowledge and skills I learned from working on this project toward my work during my internship the following summer.

I used TensorFlow and finetuned Google's Inception-v3 architecture to classify a user's face shape into one of four categories: square, heart, round, and oval. The user is able to take a picture of his or her face using a computer webcam, have his or her face classified, and have glasses frames recommended based on the classified face shape. The recommendations include pictures of multiple frames, links to specific websites to purchase them, as well as a button to shuffle through the list of frames.
